Physicians, residents, and other healthcare professionals have first-hand experience with some of healthcare's bigest challenges, but might not have the business skills or technical ability to turn ideas into startups. Undergraduate students might be interested in the healthcare and healthcare tech space, but might not have the domain expertise suited to for the industry. By pairing these two groups together, we aim to build talented, dynamic teams to work on some of healthcare's most challenging problems.
