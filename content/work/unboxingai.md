UnboxingAI was founded by four undergraduate members in Helix and two doctors from Yale Medical School. Our goal was to commercialize a proprietary, patented algorithm that generated an explainable medical diagnosis for liver cancer, a solution to the ‘blackbox’ of AI that has become a major hurdle in the healthcare industry. Although we decided to move on from the project after a year of working together, we learned a great deal about starting a company and the importance of communication. We hope to each find new projects to work on and are excited to continue being involved with the Helix community!
